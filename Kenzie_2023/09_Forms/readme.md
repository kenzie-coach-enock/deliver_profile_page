# Forms

## Introduction  

![form_example](assets/form-example.svg)

I learned that forms are essential to most websites because they allow us to request, process, and send user information to the back-end. Examples include login pages, text fields for posting on Twitter, and registration forms. In this context, HTML handles only the visual aspect of the form, such as text fields, numbers, options, and buttons.

## HTML Structure of a Form  
To create a form, I used the `<form>` tag. This tag tells the browser that the fields within it will receive values that can be sent to a server. Inside the form, I used various input fields:

- **input**: for text, numbers, dates, files, URLs, delimiters, colors, etc.  
- **select**: for option fields.  
- **textarea**: for longer text fields and formatting.

## Conclusion  
The learning experience helped me understand the basic structure of forms in HTML, and Iâ€™m excited to dive deeper into each tag in future lessons.
