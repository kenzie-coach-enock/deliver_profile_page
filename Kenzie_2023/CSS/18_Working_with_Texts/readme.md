# Working with Texts

## Introduction
In this course, I learned how to customize text using CSS by manipulating five visual attributes: Size, Line Height, Weight (or Thickness), Color, and Family.

## Size
I explored how to adjust the font size of text, which is crucial for creating a visually appealing layout. 

## Line Height
I learned about the spacing between lines of text. This aspect is important because either too much or too little space can negatively affect the user experience.

## Weight (or Thickness)
I discovered that weight refers to the density of the text, which can change the overall appearance and readability of the content.

## Color
I practiced changing the color of text, which plays a significant role in enhancing the visual appeal of a webpage.

## Family
I explored different text styles based on font libraries, allowing me to add variety to the typography used in my designs.

## Altering Attributes
For each of the visual results, I learned the corresponding CSS properties:
- **Size:** `font-size`
- **Line Height:** `line-height`
- **Weight:** `font-weight`
- **Color:** `color`
- **Family:** `font-family`

## Practicing
To put this knowledge into practice, I created a simple layout using HTML and CSS. I set up a folder called "TextsCSS," and within it, I created `texts.html` and `style.css`. I structured the HTML with a header and added classes for styling. I then defined the maximum width of the content and customized the styles for the title and paragraph, including size, line height, color, and weight. Finally, I imported a Google font to enhance the typography of my document.

## Conclusion
The properties I learned in this course are commonly used in CSS projects, and now I am ready to practice and apply them in real-world scenarios!
