      <p class="article-paragraph">
        Four composite images from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the James
        Webb Space Telescope provide stunning views of two galaxies, a nebula,
        and a star cluster. Each image combines Chandra's X-rays— a form of
        high-energy light— with infrared data from previously released Webb
        images, both invisible to the naked eye. Data from NASA's Hubble Space
        Telescope (optical light) and the now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope
        (infrared), along with XMM-Newton (X-rays) from the European Space
        Agency and the New Technology Telescope of the European Southern
        Observatory (optical) were also used. These cosmic wonders and details
        are made available by mapping the data and transforming it into colors
        that the human eye can perceive.
