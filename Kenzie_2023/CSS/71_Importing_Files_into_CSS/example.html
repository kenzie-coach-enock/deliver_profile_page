          Once upon a time, a developer tried to center a div. After hours of
          struggling, they gave up and declared the div perfectly aligned with
          their soul: lost and slightly off-center. Moral of the story? Always
          check your flexbox settings.

          There was a button that dreamed of becoming a submit button one day.
          It clicked and clicked, hoping someone would recognize its potential.
          But alas, the developer forgot to link it to a form, and the poor
          buttonâ€™s dreams remained unfulfilled. So close, yet so far!

          A humble CSS file once tried to make everyone happy. It styled
          buttons, gave headings bold looks, and kept the layout responsive. But
          no matter what, it could never satisfy the picky JavaScript, who
          always wanted to take control. Their rivalry continues to this day.

          Legend has it that somewhere in the depths of the codebase lies a
          magical class name, `super-container-ultimate`. It was created in
          haste and over time grew to 300 lines of CSS. Developers fear touching
          it, lest they break the layout of the entire site. Beware the
          `super-container-ultimate`!
