# Pseudo Classes

## Introduction

During this learning experience, I explored CSS pseudo-classes, which are special selectors that allow us to apply styles to HTML elements based on specific states or relationships with other elements. These states include user interactions like focus, hover, form validation, and others. Pseudo-classes are dynamic, meaning they don’t require additional HTML classes. Instead, they enable us to style elements based on how they are used or how they interact with content or the user. Pseudo-classes are prefixed with a colon (:) and provide a flexible and effective way to create interactive and responsive web designs.

## Input Pseudo-Classes

I learned about pseudo-classes specifically related to form elements, which allow styling based on the input’s state:

- **`:enabled`**: Applies styles to elements that are enabled.
- **`:disabled`**: Styles elements that are in a disabled state.
- **`:placeholder-shown`**: Styles the input field when the placeholder is displayed.
- **`:checked`**: Applies styles to selected or checked elements, such as checkboxes.
- **`:blank`**: Styles elements that are empty or not filled in.
- **`:required`**: Targets elements that are marked as required in a form.
- **`:optional`**: Applies styles to optional form elements.

## User Action Pseudo-Classes

I also explored pseudo-classes that depend on user actions, which trigger specific styles:

- **`:hover`**: Styles an element while the user hovers the mouse pointer over it.
- **`:active`**: Applies styles when an element is being activated, like when it’s clicked.
- **`:focus`**: Styles elements that have active focus, such as input fields when the user is typing.

These insights have helped me understand how pseudo-classes in CSS can significantly enhance the interactivity and user experience of web pages, making them more dynamic and responsive to user actions.
