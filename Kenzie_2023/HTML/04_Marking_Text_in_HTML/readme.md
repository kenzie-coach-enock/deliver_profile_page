# Marking Text in HTML

## Introduction
In this lesson, I learned about markup tags in HTML, which is a markup language for text. At the end of the theory, I had the opportunity to view examples of HTML and their representation on a page, and I could edit the code directly in CodePen.

## Semantics
I understood the importance of semantics in marking elements. While in traditional text editors we use visual tools like bold and italic, in HTML we have specific tags that provide meaning to the content. For example, the `<strong>` and `<em>` tags not only change the text's appearance but also indicate its significance.

## Semantic Elements
I discovered various semantic elements in HTML, such as:

- The `<p>` for paragraphs, which improves readability.
- The `<em>` and `<strong>` for emphasizing specific parts of the text.
- The `<a>` tag to create links, allowing text to relate to a specific destination.
- The `<cite>` tag to mark citations.
- The `<i>` and `<b>` elements, which now also have semantic meaning in HTML5.
- Headings, which are structured with `<h1>` to `<h6>`, creating a hierarchy in the content.
- Line breaks (`<br>`) and the `<pre>` element for preformatted text.

## HTML Entities
I learned that HTML entities are sequences of special characters used to represent symbols and characters that have special meanings in HTML. For example, to display the greater than (>) symbol without it being interpreted as a tag, we use `&gt;`. I created a list of some entities, such as `&nbsp;` for non-breaking spaces and `&copy;` for the copyright symbol.

## Conclusion
I realized that using semantic tags in HTML not only enhances the organization and readability of the code but also facilitates content interpretation and accessibility. This leads to a more effective user experience in both viewing and searching for content on the web.

I felt that this lesson was crucial for understanding how to structure my HTML code better, giving more meaning to what I am creating! ðŸ˜Š
