# HTML Fundamentals

## Introduction

I started learning about HTML, which stands for *HyperText Markup Language*. This markup language is used to describe the structure and meaning of elements on a web page. I discovered that HTML allows me to create elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other components that make up the content of a page. üçÉ

## Elements

I learned that HTML elements, or *tags*, are the building blocks of web pages. They are enclosed by "<>" and define the structure and meaning of the content displayed in the browser. Tags are used for different types of content like text, images, videos, and links, helping to organize and present information in a logical and structured way.

### Simple Example:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
In this example, I used the `<p>` tag to define a paragraph. The opening `<p>` tag marks the start of the paragraph, and the closing `</p>` tag indicates the end. Everything between them is considered part of the paragraph.

## Other Important Tags

I realized that it's essential to understand the main HTML tags because they are the foundation for building web content. Each tag has a specific purpose, and here are a few important ones I learned:

- `<h1> - <h6>`: Used to define headings and subheadings. `<h1>` is the main heading, and `<h6>` is the smallest subheading.
- `<p>`: Used to create paragraphs of text, organizing the content into blocks.
- `<a>`: This tag creates links. It's used around text or images that are clickable, redirecting the user to other pages or resources.
- `<img>`: Used to display images on a page.

## Conclusion

I feel that as I continue my programming journey, I will explore a wide range of HTML elements and learn how to use them to create more interactive and engaging web pages. I'm excited to apply this knowledge and see what I can build! üöÄ
