# Semantic Tags

## Introduction
When I create a website, I must consider various factors, such as semantic structure, accessibility, and search engines.

## Semantic Tags and Their Meanings
When we talk about interpreting code, we refer to its meaning. Various programs and search engines will read my website to identify the types of content present, determining which elements are most important, like the footer and the menu.

## Accessibility
Itâ€™s not just Google bots that seek to identify where each content piece is located within the HTML. Applications used by visually impaired individuals also try to recognize sections and the importance of each content piece to provide audio interpretation for the user.

## Page Structure Divided into Blocks
When I access a website, I notice a division of content, such as sections for photos, menus, footers, etc. I learned that I can separate content using the `<div>` tag for aesthetic purposes, although this tag has no inherent meaning or semantics.

## HTML 5
With HTML 5, I discovered that I can make the code more descriptive for both writers and readers, as well as for search engines and accessibility applications. I can use more descriptive tags, like `<section>` for sections of my website and `<header>` for important content displayed at the top of the page.

## Determining the Main Content of the Page
I learned to use semantic tags to indicate which content on a page should be prioritized. The `<main>` tag is particularly useful for wrapping the main content of a page.

## Articles, News, and Posts
When creating a blog, I can structure my HTML to indicate specific sections as articles using the `<article>` tag. This tag will be frequently utilized throughout the first module of my course.

## Conclusion
Understanding semantics is crucial for front-end developers. Search engines prefer and give more importance to applications that use semantic tags, as they help differentiate the significance and meaning of content.
