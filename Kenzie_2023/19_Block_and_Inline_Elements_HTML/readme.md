# Block and Inline Elements (HTML)

## Introduction
In this course, I learned about HTML elements, which can be classified into two main groups: block elements and inline elements. Understanding this classification is crucial as it lays the groundwork for future work with CSS, where I can manipulate the default behavior of these elements.

## Inline Elements
I discovered that inline elements occupy only the necessary width for display and can share the same line with other elements. Examples include:
- `<span>`: A generic tag without semantic value.
- `<strong>`: A semantic tag indicating importance in the text.
- `<em>`: A semantic tag used for emphasis.
- `<a>`: An anchor tag for creating hyperlinks.
- `<img>`: A tag for inserting images.

## Block Elements
In contrast, block elements take up the entire horizontal space available and begin on a new line. They stack vertically, one below the other. Examples include:
- `<div>`: A generic tag without semantic value.
- `<h1>`: A heading tag.
- `<p>`: A paragraph tag.
- `<ul>`: An unordered list tag.
- `<ol>`: An ordered list tag.
- `<form>`: A form tag.

## Block vs. Inline
With a solid understanding of these elements, I practiced differentiating between them. I created a `<section>` containing two inline elements (`<span>`) displaying "Hello World" and two block elements (`<div>`) with "Hello World" in each paragraph. The inline elements appeared side by side, while the block elements started on a new line.

## Conclusion
I concluded the lesson by realizing the importance of practicing these concepts to solidify my understanding of inline and block elements. Now, it's time for me to apply what I've learned! 

This exercise reinforced the difference between inline elements, which only use the space they need, and block elements, which take up the full width of their container.
