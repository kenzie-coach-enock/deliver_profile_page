      Emmet is a shortcut used to create multiple elements a bit faster.
      Since we already know the structure, it can be productive to create the structure
      and then fill it with text. I will leave the shortcuts to exemplify.
      Legend of the operators used here: 
      > indicates that the element will be placed inside the previous element.
      + indicates that the element will be created after the other.
      () is used to indicate the start and end of a structure.

      <!--
      Remember to type to activate Emmet, 
      or paste and give the command ctrl + space, then just hit enter.

        <h2>What is the IT Field?</h2>

        <p>
          The <strong>IT field</strong>, or Information Technology field, is
          responsible for managing the flow of information in a computer network
          of an organization.
