# Marking Texts 

## Introduction
In this activity, I trained my knowledge of tags acquired so far. The aim was to identify HTML elements for text markup on a web page.

## Learning Experience
I began by examining a text excerpt from an article on our blog, comparing it to the original publication to identify the appropriate markup. I realized that to make the necessary tags, I needed to refer to the original text, which provided a practical challenge in recognizing and applying HTML tags.

## HTML Markup
The text discussed the thriving IT market, highlighting how it remains resilient during critical situations, such as the recent health crisis. It emphasized the demand for skilled professionals in technology and the diverse roles within the field, including web developers, DevOps, and data analysts. The broader landscape of IT careers was also covered, particularly the growing fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

To assist in the markup process, I learned about using the standard HTML structure, incorporating shortcuts with Emmet. This tool significantly simplified writing tags efficiently.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this exercise enabled me to practice identifying sections, titles, paragraphs, and emphasized text in HTML, enhancing my understanding of how to effectively structure web content. Now, I am ready to identify the required segments and make the necessary modifications!
