# Introduction to CSS

## Introduction
In this lesson, I had my first encounter with CSS (Cascading Style Sheet), which is used to style elements created with markup languages like HTML.

## Understanding CSS
I learned that modern websites consist of three key components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each of these plays a specific role to work dynamically and productively:

- **HTML:** Defines the structure of a website.
- **CSS:** Defines the appearance, style, and presentation of a website.
- **JavaScript:** Defines the behavior and interactivity with users.

With this knowledge, I can easily understand the significant impact CSS has on our websites.

## Example
We looked at two images of the Kenzie website: one styled with CSS and another without any styling. The difference was striking! 

The first image showcased a stylish version of the site, featuring a modern and attractive layout with well-organized elements. The contrasting colors of headers and paragraphs made reading easy, and the buttons stood out with subtle borders and shadows. 

In contrast, the second image showed the same site without CSS styling. Although the layout remained the same, there were no defined colors, sizes, or spacing. The headers and paragraphs appeared in the browser’s default format, and the buttons looked plain and unstyled against a white background.

## Conclusion
Overall, applying CSS to a web page enhances its visual appeal through colors, fonts, spacing, and element positioning. These changes aim to make the page aesthetically pleasing, improve navigation, and highlight important information. However, it’s important to note that even with just HTML, the content and structure of the page remain intact, ensuring accessibility for visually impaired individuals.
