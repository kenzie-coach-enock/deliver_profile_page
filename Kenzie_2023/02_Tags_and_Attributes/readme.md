# Tags and Attributes

## Introduction
As I learned HTML, I understood that it is a markup language used by browsers to interpret web content. The core of HTML is the use of **tags**, which are enclosed by `<` and `>`. Tags are generally used in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. Additionally, I learned that tags can be nested, meaning one tag can contain another, as shown in the example with `<pizza>` and its various `<sabor>` elements.

## Attributes
Another important part of the learning process was understanding **attributes**, which are used to provide additional information or modify the behavior of tags. For example, in the `<img>` tag, the `src` attribute defines the imageâ€™s location, while `alt` provides an alternative text if the image cannot be loaded. I also discovered that some tags, like `<img>`, are self-closing because they do not contain content.

## Other Tags
I explored some specific tags that are frequently used in creating lists and tables. For lists, the tags `<ul>` and `<li>` create unordered lists, while `<ol>` and `<li>` create ordered lists, with the difference being that ordered lists are numbered. For tables, the tags `<table>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>` define the basic structure, where `<tr>` represents rows, and `<td>` represents cells.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, understanding these tags and attributes is crucial for building a solid and functional webpage structure. Now that I have grasped these concepts, I am ready to practice, always keeping in mind the importance of good practices and semantics when writing HTML code! ðŸ˜„
