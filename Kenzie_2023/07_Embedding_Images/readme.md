# Embedding Images

## Introduction
I learned how to insert images into an HTML document using the `<img>` tag, which features automatic closing.

## Anatomy and Attributes
I discovered several attributes associated with the `<img>` tag and how to declare them. 

- **src**: This mandatory attribute indicates the image path in the document.
- **alt**: While not required, this attribute provides alternative text for the image. It enhances accessibility, allowing screen readers to interpret the image in text form if it fails to render.
- **height**: This attribute sets the element's height, typically in pixels.
- **width**: Similar to height, this attribute defines the element's width in pixels.

## Examples
I reviewed examples demonstrating the use of the `<img>` tag, including:

- An image used as a link, allowing redirection to another page.
- Specifying width and height to define the image size.
- Using the alt attribute to provide a description of the image.

## Organizing Images
After mastering image insertion in HTML, I learned about organizing images within a project. Here are some key tips:

1. **First Tip**: I should create an `img` folder in my project to store all images. This helps keep my project organized and allows me to use local images or those hosted online.
  
2. **Second Tip**: It's not advisable to link to images from external sites, as they may become unavailable, breaking my application. I should look for images with appropriate licensing.

3. **Third Tip**: With the `img` folder created, the path to my image should always follow the format: `"./img/imagename.extension"`.

## Conclusion
While organizing folders and naming conventions is not strictly enforced, I found it beneficial to adopt this approach. I’ll create an `index.html` file in the root of my project for future developments in the course.
