// Exercise 1
// Declare a variable called num1 and assign the value 5 to it.

// Exercise 2
// Declare a variable called pi and assign the value 3.14 to it.
let pi = 3.14;

// Declare a variable called radius and assign the value 5 to it.
let radius = 5;

// Calculate the circumference based on the radius.
// To calculate the circumference, multiply the radius by the value of pi and by two.

console.log(`The circumference of a circle with radius ${radius} is: ${circumference}.`);

// Exercise 3
// Declare a variable called temperature and assign the value 30 to it.
let temperature = 30;

// Declare a variable called fahrenheit and assign to it the result of converting the temperature to Fahrenheit.
// To convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply the temperature by 9, divide the result by 5, and add 32.
let fahrenheit = (temperature * 9) / 5 + 32;

// Print the result of the conversion to Fahrenheit in the console.
console.log(`${temperature} degrees Celsius is equal to ${fahrenheit} degrees Fahrenheit.`);

// Exercise 4
// Declare a variable called grade1 and assign the value 7 to it.
let grade1 = 7;

// Declare a variable called grade2 and assign the value 9 to it.
let grade2 = 9;

// Calculate the average of the grades by adding the two grades and dividing the result by 2.
// We divide by 2 to calculate the average of the two grades.
let average = (grade1 + grade2) / 2;

// Print the result of the average in the console.
console.log(`The average of grade1 (${grade1}) and grade2 (${grade2}) is: ${average}.`);

// Exercise 5
// Declare a variable called width and assign the value 10 to it.
let width = 10;

// Declare a variable called length and assign the value 20 to it.
let length = 20;

// Calculate the area by multiplying the width by the length.
let area = width * length;

// Print the result of the area in the console.
console.log(`The area of a rectangle with width ${width} and length ${length} is: ${area}.`);

// Exercise 6
// Declare a variable called grossSalary and assign the value 5000 to it.
let grossSalary = 5000;

// Declare a variable called discount and assign to it the result of the discount calculation.
// The discount is calculated by multiplying the gross salary by 0.1, which represents 10%.
let discount = grossSalary * 0.1;

// Calculate the net salary by subtracting the discount from the gross salary.
let netSalary = grossSalary - discount;

// Print the result of the net salary in the console.
console.log(`The net salary after a discount of ${discount} from the gross salary of ${grossSalary} is: ${netSalary}.`);

// Exercise 7
// Declare a variable called hoursWorked and assign the value 40 to it.
let hoursWorked = 40;

// Declare a variable called hourlyRate and assign the value 50 to it.
let hourlyRate = 50;

// Calculate the gross salary by multiplying the hours worked by the hourly rate.
let grossSalaryFromHours = hoursWorked * hourlyRate;

// Print the result of the gross salary in the console.
console.log(`The gross salary for working ${hoursWorked} hours at a rate of ${hourlyRate} per hour is: ${grossSalaryFromHours}.`);
