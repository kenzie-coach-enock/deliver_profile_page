# Introduction to JSON

## Introduction
In this lesson, I learned about JSON, a lightweight and easy-to-understand data format widely used in web applications for transmitting data to and from servers.

## What is JSON?
I discovered that JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a data format consisting of key-value pairs, similar to a JavaScript object. However, one key difference is that JSON is actually a text format. I found it interesting that JSON is language-independent, which allows it to be utilized with various programming languages, including JavaScript, PHP, and Python. This versatility highlighted how many languages leverage JSON for data transport, not just JavaScript!

## JSON Structure
I explored the simple structure of JSON data. JSON is written in key-value pairs, separated by commas and enclosed in curly braces { }. For example:

```json
{
    "name": "João",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "São Paulo",
    "interests": ["music", "cooking"]
}
```

In this example, I observed an object with four key-value pairs: name, age, city, and interests. The keys are strings identifying the associated values, which can be strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays, or null. This clarity in structure made JSON very approachable.

## Conclusion
Overall, I realized that JSON is a widely used data format in web applications. Its simplicity and ease of use, along with its compatibility with multiple programming languages, make it a valuable tool in my development toolkit.
