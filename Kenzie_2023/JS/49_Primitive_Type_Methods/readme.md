# Primitive Type Methods

## Introduction
During this learning experience, I dove deep into JavaScript methods, which are essentially functions designed to perform specific operations or manipulate data. They play a fundamental role in simplifying how we achieve desired outcomes in our code. JavaScript provides a vast array of native methods that cater to different types of data, including strings, numbers, arrays, and objects.

## String Methods
I explored some of the key methods that work with strings, a crucial data type in JavaScript. For example:

- **replace()**: This method allows for replacing a specific part of a string with another. I learned that it only replaces the first occurrence, while the similar **replaceAll()** handles all occurrences of a substring within the string.

- **startsWith()**: This method checks if a string begins with specific characters, which is especially useful for validating or filtering input.

## Number Methods
The course also introduced me to several methods for working with numbers. These methods make it easier to manipulate numeric data in common scenarios:

- **toFixed()**: This method rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places and returns the result as a string. It was fascinating to see how the method could adjust both the integer and fractional parts of a number.

- **isInteger()**: A simple but useful method that checks if a given value is an integer, returning a boolean. It's particularly helpful when validating input.

- **parseInt()**: This method converts a string into an integer, which is crucial when dealing with user inputs that might be in string form but represent numbers.

## Conclusion
This learning experience reinforced the importance of JavaScript methods in enhancing productivity. While it's essential to know and practice these methods, I also realized the importance of understanding how to achieve results without them. This foundational knowledge strengthens my ability to grasp the core principles of the language. For further exploration, resources like MDN and W3Schools provide detailed documentation on the many available methods.
