# Introduction to Loops

## Introduction
In my recent learning experience, I delved into **loops**, which are essential structures in JavaScript (and many other programming languages). Loops allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. Understanding and using loops efficiently is crucial for writing clean and effective code.

## Structures
I explored the three basic types of loops in JavaScript:

- **for loop**: This loop is ideal when we know exactly how many times we want the code to run. It uses a control variable that is initialized, checked against a condition, and incremented or decremented with each iteration. This was especially useful when dealing with fixed ranges or arrays.
  
- **while loop**: I learned that the **while loop** is better suited for situations where we donâ€™t know in advance how many iterations are needed. The loop continues as long as the condition remains true, making it more flexible for certain scenarios.

- **do...while loop**: Finally, I practiced using the **do...while loop**, which is quite similar to the **while loop**, but it guarantees at least one execution of the code inside the loop, even if the condition is false at the start. This was useful for ensuring initial actions are always performed before any condition check.

## Conclusion
This learning experience highlighted the power of loops in automating repetitive tasks. When combined with **if/else** statements (control flow structures), loops help create more complex and dynamic programs in JavaScript. It was a great journey into one of the core concepts of programming!
