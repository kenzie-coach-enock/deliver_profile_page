# Introduction to Events

## Introduction
I discovered that events are actions or movements that happen on a web page, occurring constantly during my browsing experience. I learned that events can be triggered by user interactions, such as clicks or scrolling, or by actions of the window/document itself, like page loading. These events allow me to respond to user interactions with the web page.

## Intercepting Events
I realized that most events are associated with HTML elements like buttons, links, text boxes, and images. I can assign event handlers to these elements to control their behavior when an event occurs. For example, I learned to capture an HTML element using the DOM and add an event listener. By using the `addEventListener` method, I can specify the type of event to listen for and define the behavior with a callback function. In my first example, I added a click event listener to a button that logs "hello world" to the console when clicked.

## Types of Events
I explored various types of events available in JavaScript. Some of the most common ones include mouse events (like click, double click, and mouseover), focus events (such as focus and blur), form events (like submit), input events (triggered whenever a user modifies a field), keyboard events (like keydown and keyup), and page loading events (such as DOMContentLoaded and unload). Understanding these events enhances my ability to create interactive web applications.

## Conclusion
Overall, I gained valuable insights into how events work in JavaScript and how to manage them effectively to improve user interaction on web pages. For further details, I will check the provided links for more information.
