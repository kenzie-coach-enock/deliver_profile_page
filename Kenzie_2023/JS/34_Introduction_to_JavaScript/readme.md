# Introduction to JavaScript

## Introduction
I learned that JavaScript is a widely used programming language for creating web applications and adding interactivity to web pages. With JavaScript, I can introduce dynamic behavior like animations, interactive forms, and pop-up messages to enhance the user experience. Furthermore, I can develop complete web applications, such as games and content management systems, with JavaScript, which is compatible with all major web browsers.

## Concepts
The course introduced me to the concept of programming languages, which are used to communicate instructions to computers. Much like how humans use different spoken languages like English, Portuguese, and French, computers interpret instructions through programming languages. JavaScript is one of these languages, alongside others like Python, Java, and PHP. These languages translate the programmer's instructions into machine-level commands.

The instructions can vary from simple tasks, like adding two numbers, to complex operations involving hundreds of variables. Although many programming languages exist for different purposes, they all share the same core principle—executing the programmer’s commands on a machine level.

## JavaScript on the Client-Side
I also learned about JavaScript engines, such as V8 in Google Chrome, which allow browsers to interpret and run JavaScript code. This makes JavaScript highly popular among web developers since it can be executed in almost any web browser—Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.

## JavaScript in the Browser
I discovered how to use the developer tools in a browser to write and test JavaScript. By right-clicking on a webpage and selecting “Inspect” or pressing F12, I can access the browser's console. In this console, I can execute JavaScript code directly.

## Writing Code and Errors in the Console
If there are pre-existing codes or error messages in the console, I can clear them by selecting the “Clear Console” option or pressing “CTRL + L.” This console also allows me to run basic operations like adding or dividing numbers. For example, typing `100 + 270` and pressing "Enter" returns `370`.

## Console View Modes
I also learned how to customize the console’s view by selecting options under "Customize and control dev tools" (the three dots) and adjusting the "Dock Side" settings for better visualization.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used on both the client and server sides. This flexibility offers developers various possibilities for creating modern and interactive web applications. The hands-on practice with browser developer tools was an eye-opener in understanding how JavaScript is executed in real-world web environments.
