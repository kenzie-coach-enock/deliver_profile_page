# Intruduction to Functions

## Introduction
In this lesson, I learned that functions are a way to organize an algorithm into a closed block of code. Functions allow us to break the code into smaller parts, making it reusable by simply referencing the function without having to rewrite the entire code.

For example, let's say we need an algorithm that outputs a formatted string with a person's full name and the company they work for. Instead of repeating the same code multiple times throughout a project, we can create a function to handle this task.

## Learning Experience
I started with a simple example where I printed the full name and company information directly using `console.log` and template strings. While this approach worked, it led to code duplication every time I wanted to display the information.

To improve the code, I created a function called `formataNomeEmpresa`, which holds the logic to format and print the name and company. By calling this function, the code became more organized and avoided repetition, as I could now display the formatted string by simply invoking the function.

This lesson highlighted the value of functions in keeping code clean and maintainable. By encapsulating specific logic within functions, I can reuse code easily and make future updates more manageable.

## Conclusion
In this session, I learned how to encapsulate code within a function and call it whenever needed. This approach significantly improves code organization and simplifies maintenance in future projects.
