# Type String

## Introduction
In this lesson, I learned that a string is a data type in JavaScript that represents text, composed of a sequence of characters, including letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. Strings can be enclosed in single quotes (') or double quotes ("), as long as they are consistent. One important aspect of strings is that they are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed once created. However, I can manipulate and concatenate strings to create new ones. JavaScript provides several built-in functions and methods for working with strings, such as `length`, `toUpperCase`, `toLowerCase`, and `substring`.

## Concatenating Strings
I explored how to concatenate strings, which means joining two or more strings into a single one. For instance, I can combine "Hello" and "world" to form "Hello world." There are different ways to concatenate strings, such as using the `+` operator or the `concat` method. This technique is often useful for assembling complex strings from different parts.

## Template Strings
I discovered template strings, which offer a more powerful way to concatenate strings in JavaScript. Defined using backticks (`` ` ``) instead of quotes, template strings allow me to embed variables directly in the string. This eliminates the need for manual concatenation. For example, I can create a message that includes multiple variables, making my code cleaner and easier to read.

## Converting Strings to Numbers
I also learned how to convert strings to numbers in JavaScript using `parseInt` and `parseFloat`. For instance, when I use `parseInt` on the string "10," it converts it to the number 10, and `parseFloat` does the same for "20.5," yielding 20.5. If a string cannot be converted into a valid number, both methods return NaN (Not a Number). Itâ€™s crucial to verify these conversions before using them in calculations.

## Conclusion
In summary, I gained valuable skills in working with strings, including concatenation, manipulation, and conversion to numbers. Understanding how to effectively handle strings will prepare me for a wide range of applications and projects in JavaScript development. The knowledge I acquired in this lesson will be beneficial as I continue my journey to becoming a proficient JavaScript developer.

```js
// Exercise 1
// Create a program that concatenates two names and returns a greeting phrase.
// Input: firstName = "John", lastName = "Smith"
// Output: "Hello John Smith!"

// Declare a variable called firstName and assign it the value "John".
let firstName = 'John';

// Declare a variable called lastName and assign it the value "Smith".
let lastName = 'Smith';

// Create a new variable called greeting and assign it the concatenation of the strings "Hello, ", firstName, " " and lastName, forming the complete greeting.
let greeting = 'Hello, ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName + '!';

// Print the greeting variable in the console.
console.log('Greeting message:', greeting);

// Exercise 2
// Create a program that adds one string to the end of another string and returns the resulting string.
// Input: string1 = "hello", string2 = "world"
// Output: "helloworld"

// Declare a variable called string1 and assign it the string "hello".
let string1 = 'hello';

// Declare a variable called string2 and assign it the string "world".
let string2 = 'world';

// Concatenate (add) the two strings and assign the result to a variable called combinedString.
let combinedString = string1 + string2;

// Print the resulting string in the console.
console.log('Combined string:', combinedString);

// Exercise 3
// Create a program that receives a string in decimal number format and returns the equivalent integer.
// Input: "12.5"
// Output: 12

// Declare a variable called decimalNumber and assign it a string representing a decimal number, for example, "12.5".
let decimalNumber = '12.5';

// Use the parseInt() function to convert the string to an integer and assign the result to the variable integerNumber.
let integerNumber = parseInt(decimalNumber);

// Print the value of the integerNumber variable in the console.
console.log('Converted integer from decimal string:', integerNumber);

// Exercise 4
// Create a program that converts a string in integer format to an integer number.
// Input: "12" Output: 12

// Create a variable called integerString and assign it the string "12".
let integerString = '12';

// Use the parseInt() function to convert the string to an integer.
// The parseInt() function parses the string and returns an integer.
// The converted value is then printed in the console using console.log().
console.log('Converted integer from string:', parseInt(integerString));

// Exercise 5
// Create a program that converts two strings in integer format to integers, sums those numbers, and presents the result.
// Input 1: "12" Input 2: "3"
// Output: 15

// Create a variable called number1 and assign it the string "12".
let number1 = '12';

// Create a variable called number2 and assign it the string "3".
let number2 = '3';

// Use the parseInt() function to convert the string number1 into an integer.
let convertedNumber1 = parseInt(number1);

// Use the parseInt() function to convert the string number2 into an integer.
let convertedNumber2 = parseInt(number2);

// Sum the two converted integer numbers and print the result in the console.
// The sum is performed using the addition operator (+).
console.log('Sum of the two integers:', convertedNumber1 + convertedNumber2);
