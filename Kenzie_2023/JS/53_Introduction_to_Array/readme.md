# Introduction to Arrays

## Introduction
I learned that arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming, used to store collections of related values, such as lists of numbers or names.

## Syntax
I discovered how to declare an array using literal syntax with brackets ([ ]). The elements of an array can be of any type, like in the example:

```javascript
const myArray = [1, "A String", true, 50.13];
```

## Accessing Values
I learned that arrays in JavaScript are indexed by non-negative integers, starting from zero. I can access individual elements using the bracket operator ([ ]) and the element's index. For example:

```javascript
const myArray = [12, "Hello", 34, 2.3, "world"];
console.log(myArray[0]); // Output: 12
console.log(myArray[4]); // Output: "world"
```

## Main Methods
I explored various native methods for manipulating arrays in JavaScript:

- **push()**: Adds one or more elements to the end of the array and returns the new length.
- **pop()**: Removes the last element from the array and returns it.
- **shift()**: Removes the first element from the array and returns the removed element, shifting other elements to lower indices.
- **unshift()**: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array and returns the new length, shifting other elements to higher indices.
- **length**: Returns the number of elements currently in the array.

I practiced these methods with examples, like adding and removing elements from arrays.

## Conclusion
I concluded that arrays in JavaScript are powerful and versatile tools used in various programming contexts. Understanding the basic principles of using arrays will enable me to utilize them effectively in my projects.
